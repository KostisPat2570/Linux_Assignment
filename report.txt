### PART 1

After running assignment.sh and getting the comparison reports between the merged exon sequence and all the 497 exons that compose the first 42 genes of this multiple alignment, I run a python script to extract the 5 exons with the closest phylogeny (least distance (d) between trees) to the merged exon sequence.

Those exons are exon317 (d=6), exon12 (d=10), exon119 (d=10), exon255 (d=10) and exon55 (d=12) and I run the gene sequence (human) they originate from on blastp to check the name of the gene.



* exon317 (originates from gene27): PROTEIN NAME: Elongin-A protein // GENE NAME: ELOA

Elongin A, encoded by the ELOA gene, is a crucial component of the transcription factor B (SIII) complex, which also includes Elongin B and Elongin C. This complex enhances the elongation phase of RNA polymerase II transcription by alleviating transient pauses during transcription. Within this assembly, Elongin A serves as the active subunit, while Elongins B and C function as regulatory subunits. 

In vitro studies have demonstrated that Elongin A significantly stimulates RNA polymerase II transcription elongation. In vivo research has shown that in mouse embryonic stem cells, Elongin A associates with numerous actively transcribed genes, particularly near transcription start sites and promoter-proximal regions, suggesting its involvement in modulating transcriptional activity.

The ELOA gene is located on chromosome 1p36.1. Mutations or alterations in this gene have been linked to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 69 and Cockayne Syndrome B.

Additionally, the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein interacts with Elongin B and C, inhibiting transcription elongation. This interaction underscores the complex regulatory mechanisms governing gene expression and highlights the potential implications of Elongin A in various diseases.



* exon12 (originates from gene1): PROTEIN NAME: Protein-Associating with the Carboxyl-Terminal Domain of Ezrin Isoform 2 // GENE NAME: SCYL3

The protein associated with the carboxyl-terminal domain of ezrin isoform 2 corresponds to the SCYL3 gene, also known as PACE-1. SCYL3 encodes a protein characterized by a kinase-like domain and four HEAT repeats, which are implicated in intracellular transport and signaling pathways. Although it contains a kinase domain, SCYL3 is classified as a pseudokinase due to the absence of certain residues essential for catalytic activity. This suggests that, while it may not possess enzymatic function, SCYL3 could play a role in scaffolding or regulatory processes within the cell.

SCYL3 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and has been observed in the Golgi apparatus. Its interaction with the C-terminal domain of ezrin indicates a potential involvement in linking the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby influencing cell adhesion and migration. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. 

The gene is located on chromosome 1 at position 1q42.13. While specific diseases directly associated with SCYL3 mutations are not well-documented, its expression patterns and interactions suggest a role in various cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation and cell migration.

In summary, SCYL3 (PACE-1) is a pseudokinase that interacts with ezrin's C-terminal domain, potentially contributing to cytoskeletal organization and cellular dynamics.



* exon119 (originates from gene10): PROTEIN NAME: Suppressor of Tumorigenicity 7 Protein-Like Isoform 1 // GENE NAME: ST7L

The Suppressor of Tumorigenicity 7 Protein-Like Isoform 1 (ST7L Isoform 1) is a protein encoded by the ST7L gene in humans. This gene is located on chromosome 1p13.2 and is known to produce multiple transcript variants through alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms of the protein.

Structurally, ST7L Isoform 1 comprises 575 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 64.8 kDa. The protein belongs to the ST7 family and shares homology with the Suppressor of Tumorigenicity 7 (ST7) protein. However, the precise molecular function of ST7L Isoform 1 remains to be fully elucidated.

Emerging research suggests that ST7L may play a role in modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation. For instance, studies have indicated that suppression of ST7L can activate the Wnt/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling cascade, leading to increased proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. Additionally, in pancreatic cancer cells, miR-331-3p has been shown to confer drug resistance by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling via ST7L. 

Despite these insights, the comprehensive biological functions and potential clinical implications of ST7L Isoform 1 require further investigation to fully understand its role in human health and disease.



* exon 255 (originates from gene20): PROTEIN NAME: Mannan-Binding Lectin Serine Protease 2 Isoform 1 Preproprotein // GENE NAME: MASP-2

Mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2 (MASP-2) isoform 1 preproprotein is a crucial enzyme in the lectin pathway of the complement system, an integral component of innate immunity. Encoded by the MASP2 gene in humans, this protein plays a pivotal role in host defense mechanisms against pathogens.

Structure and Activation:

MASP-2 is synthesized as a preproprotein, which undergoes post-translational modifications to become an active serine protease. It associates with pattern recognition molecules such as mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins. Upon binding of these complexes to pathogen-associated molecular patterns, MASP-2 is activated, leading to the initiation of the complement cascade.

Function in the Complement System:

Once activated, MASP-2 cleaves complement components C4 and C2, resulting in the formation of the C3 convertase (C4bC2b). This enzyme complex plays a central role in opsonization, inflammation, and the formation of the membrane attack complex, which can directly lyse pathogens.

Clinical Significance:

Deficiencies or mutations in the MASP2 gene can impair the lectin pathway, leading to increased susceptibility to infections and influencing the severity of autoimmune diseases. Conversely, excessive activation of MASP-2 has been implicated in inflammatory conditions, making it a potential therapeutic target for modulating immune responses.

Understanding the structure and function of MASP-2 isoform 1 preproprotein is essential for developing interventions aimed at regulating the lectin pathway in various disease contexts.



* exon55 (originates from gene4): PROTEIN NAME: Complement Factor H Isoform A Precursor // GENE NAME: CFH

Complement Factor H (CFH) is a crucial regulatory glycoprotein in the alternative pathway of the complement system, an essential component of innate immunity. The CFH isoform a precursor, encoded by the CFH gene located on chromosome 1q32, undergoes post-translational modifications to become the mature CFH protein.

Structure:

CFH is composed of 20 short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, also known as complement control protein (CCP) modules. Each SCR domain consists of approximately 60 amino acids, facilitating specific interactions with various ligands.

Function:

CFH serves as a soluble inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway, protecting host cells from unintended complement activation. Its primary functions include:

Decay-Accelerating Activity: CFH accelerates the decay of the alternative pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb), preventing excessive complement activation.

Cofactor Activity: It acts as a cofactor for factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b into inactive fragments, thereby regulating complement activity.

Clinical Significance:

Mutations or polymorphisms in the CFH gene are associated with various diseases, including:

Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD): Certain CFH variants significantly increase the risk of developing AMD, a leading cause of vision loss in older adults.

Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS): Deficiencies or dysfunctions in CFH can lead to uncontrolled complement activation, contributing to aHUS, a condition characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure.

Understanding the structure and function of CFH is vital for developing therapeutic strategies targeting complement-mediated diseases.
